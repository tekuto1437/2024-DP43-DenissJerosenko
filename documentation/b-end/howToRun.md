# Starting a Python Django Application

This guide will walk you through the steps to start a Python Django application on your local machine. It covers setting up a virtual environment, installing Python, installing dependencies from a requirements file, and running migrations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (preferably Python 3.x)
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for version control if your Django application is hosted on a Git repository)

## Step 1: Install Python

If you haven't already installed Python, download and install it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH during the installation process.

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project.

Create a virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```
````

Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Clone the Repository (if applicable)

If your Django application is hosted in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your Git repository.

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the directory of your Django project and install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 5: Running Migrations

Once the dependencies are installed, you need to run database migrations to create database tables based on your Django models.

Run the following command to apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This command will synchronize the database state with the current set of models and create necessary database tables.

## Step 6: Start the Development Server

You can now start the Django development server to see your application in action.

Run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This command will start the development server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Open a web browser and navigate to this URL to view your Django application.

Also `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` will run the admin pannel
