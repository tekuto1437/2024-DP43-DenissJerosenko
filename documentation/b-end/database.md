Sure, here's an explanation of SQLite database in the context of a Django project:

```plaintext
db.sqlite3           # SQLite database file
```

Now, let's break down its role and structure:

1. **SQLite Database (`db.sqlite3`)**:
   - SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained, and zero-configuration SQL database engine.
   - In a Django project, by default, SQLite is used as the database backend during development.
   - The `db.sqlite3` file is the SQLite database file created by Django when you run `python manage.py migrate`.
   - It contains all the tables and data defined by your Django models and their corresponding migrations.

SQLite is often preferred for small to medium-sized projects or when simplicity and ease of use are prioritized. It's an excellent choice for development and prototyping due to its simplicity and minimal setup requirements. However, for larger-scale projects or those with higher concurrency requirements, other relational database management systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB may be more suitable.
