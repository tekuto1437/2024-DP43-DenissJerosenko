## Django Views Explanation

This code defines Django REST Framework views that handle various HTTP requests and return appropriate responses.

### `ProductListView`

- **GET Request**:
  - Retrieves a list of products grouped by category.
  - Returns a serialized representation of the menu using the `MenuSerializer`.

### `ProductView`

- **GET Request**:
  - Retrieves details of a specific product identified by its primary key (`pk`).
  - Returns a serialized representation of the product using the `ProductSerializer`.

### `ProductFeaturingView`

- **GET Request**:
  - Retrieves a list of products marked as featuring.
  - Returns a serialized representation of the featured products using the `ProductSerializer`.

### `CartView`

- **POST Request**:
  - Processes a cart submission, either by a logged-in user or a guest user.
  - If the user is logged in, associates the cart items with the user's order.
  - If the user is a guest, creates a new customer record and order for the guest.
  - Sets the transaction ID for the order and marks it as complete if the total matches the calculated cart total.
  - Creates a new shipping address entry for the order.
  - Returns a response indicating successful payment completion.

### `AuthView`

- **GET Request**:
  - Retrieves user authentication information, including the authenticated user's username, phone number, and authentication token.
  - Returns a response containing the authentication information.

- **POST Request**:
  - Handles user registration requests.
  - Validates registration data using the `RegistrationSerializer`.
  - If registration is successful, creates a new user, generates an authentication token, and associates the user with a customer record.
  - Returns a response with registration details and authentication token.

These views implement the business logic for various API endpoints in the Django application, including product listing, product details, cart management, user authentication, and user registration.
