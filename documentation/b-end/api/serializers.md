## Django REST Framework Serializers Explanation

This code defines serializers that are used to convert Django model instances into JSON representations.

### ProductSerializer

- **Attributes**:
  - `sizes`: Serializer field that represents the related sizes of a product as string values.
- **Meta**:
  - `model`: Specifies the model to be serialized, which is `Product`.
  - `fields`: Specifies the fields to include in the serialized representation.

### MenuSerializer

- **Attributes**:
  - `products`: Serializer field that represents the related products of a category using the `ProductSerializer`.
- **Meta**:
  - `model`: Specifies the model to be serialized, which is `Category`.
  - `fields`: Specifies the fields to include in the serialized representation.

### CartSerializer

- **Attributes**:
  - `product_name`: Serializer field that represents the name of the product in the cart.
  - `price`: Serializer field that represents the total price of the order item.
- **Meta**:
  - `model`: Specifies the model to be serialized, which is `OrderItem`.
  - `fields`: Specifies the fields to include in the serialized representation.

### RegistrationSerializer

- **Attributes**:
  - `password2`: Serializer field for confirming the password.
  - `phoneNumber`: Serializer field for the user's phone number.
- **Meta**:
  - `model`: Specifies the model to be serialized, which is `User`.
  - `fields`: Specifies the fields to include in the serialized representation.
  - `extra_kwargs`: Specifies additional options for the serializer fields.
- **Methods**:
  - `save()`: Custom method to create and save a new user instance. It performs validation for password matching and saves the user with the hashed password.

These serializers define how data should be serialized/deserialized between Django model instances and JSON representations. They specify which fields to include, how to represent related objects, and can also include custom validation and logic for creating or updating model instances.
