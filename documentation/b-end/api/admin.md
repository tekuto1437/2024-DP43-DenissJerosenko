## Django Admin Configuration Explanation

This code registers Django models with the admin interface and customizes the admin views for managing orders.

### Model Registration

- **Customer**, **Category**, **Product**, **Size**:
  - These models are registered with the Django admin interface using `admin.site.register`.
  - Registration allows administrators to view, add, edit, and delete instances of these models through the admin interface.

### Inline Models

- **OrderItemInline**:
  - Specifies an inline model for order items within the order admin interface.
  - Displays order items as a tabular format within the order detail page.
  - Uses the `OrderItem` model.

- **ShippingAddressInline**:
  - Specifies an inline model for shipping addresses within the order admin interface.
  - Displays shipping addresses as a stacked format within the order detail page.
  - Uses the `ShippingAddress` model.
  - Excludes the `customer` field from the form to prevent modification.

### Custom OrderAdmin

- **OrderAdmin**:
  - Customizes the admin interface for managing orders.
  - Uses the `admin.ModelAdmin` class as a base.
  - Specifies inlines for order items and shipping addresses.
  - Orders are displayed with associated order items and shipping addresses for easy management.

- **`@admin.register(Order)` Decorator**:
  - Registers the `Order` model with custom admin options defined in the `OrderAdmin` class.
  - Provides a decorator-based approach for customizing the admin interface for the `Order` model.

This admin configuration enhances the Django admin interface by providing a structured view for managing orders, including associated order items and shipping addresses.
