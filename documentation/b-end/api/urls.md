## Django URL Patterns Explanation

This code defines URL patterns for routing HTTP requests to views in a Django REST Framework application.

### URL Patterns

- **product-list/**:
  - Route for listing products.
  - View: `ProductListView` as a class-based view.

- **cart/**:
  - Route for managing the shopping cart.
  - View: `CartView` as a class-based view.

- **auth/**:
  - Route for authentication-related operations.
  - View: `AuthView` as a class-based view.

- **login/**:
  - Route for user login and obtaining authentication tokens.
  - View: `obtain_auth_token` from `rest_framework.authtoken.views`.

- **product-featuring/**:
  - Route for retrieving featured products.
  - View: `ProductFeaturingView` as a class-based view.

- **product/<str:pk>/**:
  - Route for retrieving, updating, or deleting a specific product identified by its primary key.
  - View: `ProductView` as a class-based view.

### Explanation

- Each URL pattern is associated with a specific view that handles the corresponding HTTP request.
- The views are implemented as class-based views, which provide reusable components for handling different types of requests.
- The `obtain_auth_token` view from `rest_framework.authtoken.views` is used for user authentication and token generation.
- Path parameters, such as `<str:pk>`, are used to capture dynamic parts of the URL, such as product IDs, which are then passed to the corresponding view.
- These URL patterns define the API endpoints that clients can interact with to perform various operations, such as listing products, managing the shopping cart, and user authentication.
