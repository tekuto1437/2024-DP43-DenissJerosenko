# Explanation of API Routes

The provided code defines constants representing the base URL and various API routes. These constants are used to construct the full URLs for making HTTP requests to specific endpoints.

## Base URL (`BASE_URL`)

This constant represents the base URL where the API is hosted. It typically includes the protocol (http:// or https://), domain or IP address, and port number if applicable. In this case, the base URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, indicating that the API is hosted locally on port 8000.

## Routes

1. **GET_PRODUCTS**: This constant represents the endpoint for fetching a list of products. It is constructed by appending `"api/product-list/"` to the base URL. When used in conjunction with Axios or similar HTTP request libraries, this route would be used to retrieve the list of products from the API.

2. **POST_AUTH**: This constant represents the endpoint for user authentication, typically used for user registration. It is constructed by appending `"api/auth/"` to the base URL. When sending a POST request to this endpoint, the API expects user registration data.

3. **POST_LOGIN**: This constant represents the endpoint for user login. It is constructed by appending `"api/login/"` to the base URL. When sending a POST request to this endpoint, the API expects user login credentials.

These constants provide a centralized location for managing API endpoints within the application. By using constants instead of hardcoding URLs throughout the codebase, it becomes easier to update endpoints or switch between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) without modifying multiple files.
