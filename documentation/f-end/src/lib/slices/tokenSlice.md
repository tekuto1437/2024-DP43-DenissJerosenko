# Explanation of Token Slice

The `tokenSlice` defines a slice of the Redux store for managing authentication token state in a React application:

## Initial State

The initial state of the `tokenSlice` includes a value property initialized to `null`.

## Reducers

- `setToken`: Updates the token value in the state to the payload value.
- `clearToken`: Sets the token value in the state to `null`.

## Actions

- `setToken`: Action creator for setting the token value.
- `clearToken`: Action creator for clearing the token value.

These action creators can be used to dispatch actions to update the authentication token state in the Redux store. They provide a straightforward and standardized way to manage authentication token-related state changes within a React application using Redux Toolkit.
