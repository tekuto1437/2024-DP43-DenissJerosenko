# Explanation of Wishless Slice

The `wishlessSlice` defines a slice of the Redux store for managing wishlist state in a React application:

## Initial State

The initial state of the `wishlessSlice` includes an `elements` property initialized to an empty array of `ItemWishless` objects.

## Reducers

- `addWish`: Adds a product to the wishlist by pushing it into the `elements` array.
- `remWish`: Removes a product from the wishlist by filtering out the product with the same ID from the `elements` array.

## Actions

- `addWish`: Action creator for adding a product to the wishlist.
- `remWish`: Action creator for removing a product from the wishlist.

These action creators provide a standardized way to dispatch actions to update the wishlist state in the Redux store. By using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`, the code is concise and efficient, making it easier to manage wishlist-related state changes within a React application.
