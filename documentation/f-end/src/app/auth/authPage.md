# AuthPage Component Explanation

This component represents the authentication page of the application. It dynamically renders either the login or register form based on the state.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports**:
  - `useState`: Hook from React used to manage state within functional components.
  - `Register`, `Login`: Components imported from `"./components/Register"` and `"./components/Login"` respectively, representing the register and login forms.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `AuthPage` arrow function component initializes a state variable `isLogin` using the `useState` hook. The initial state is `true`, indicating that the login form should be displayed initially.
  - The component returns JSX representing the structure of the authentication page:
    - A `<div>` element with Tailwind CSS classes for styling. It centers its content both vertically and horizontally and sets the background color.
    - Depending on the value of `isLogin`:
      - If `isLogin` is `true`, the `<Login>` component is rendered, passing a callback function `setIsLogin` to toggle between login and register forms.
      - If `isLogin` is `false`, the `<Register>` component is rendered, also passing `setIsLogin` as a callback function.
  - Upon clicking the "Register" link in the login form or vice versa, the state `isLogin` is updated accordingly, triggering a re-render to switch between the login and register forms.

## Conclusion

The `AuthPage` component serves as the entry point for the authentication page of the application. It dynamically renders either the login or register form based on the state, providing users with a seamless experience for authentication. By encapsulating the authentication logic and state management, this component promotes code reusability and maintainability.

# Login Component Explanation

This component represents the login form for user authentication. It allows users to input their username and password and submit the form to authenticate.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports**:
  - `Dispatch`, `FormEvent`, `SetStateAction`, `useState`: Hooks and types from React used for state management and event handling.
  - `useRouter`: Hook from Next.js used for accessing the router object.
  - `logUser`, `setToken`: Functions imported from application-specific API and Redux slice files.
  - `useAppDispatch`: Custom hook imported from application-specific hooks file.

- **Props**:
  - `setIsOpen`: Function passed as a prop to control the state of the authentication window.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `Login` function component initializes state variables `username` and `password` using the `useState` hook.
  - It defines a function `handleFormSubmit` to handle form submission. It prevents the default form submission behavior, validates the input fields, and sends an API request to authenticate the user.
  - Upon successful authentication, it dispatches an action to store the authentication token in the Redux store and redirects the user to the home page.
  - The JSX returned by the component represents the login form:
    - It contains input fields for the username and password, styled using Tailwind CSS classes.
    - The submit button triggers the `handleFormSubmit` function when clicked.
    - The "Sign up" link allows users to switch to the registration form by calling the `setIsOpen` function passed as a prop.

## Conclusion

The `Login` component provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their credentials and authenticate. It utilizes React hooks for state management and Next.js router for navigation. By encapsulating the login logic within a reusable component, this promotes code reusability and maintainability, enhancing the overall user experience of the application.

# Register Component Explanation

This component represents the registration form for user sign-up. It allows users to input their username, phone number, password, and confirm password, and submit the form to register a new account.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports**:
  - `Dispatch`, `SetStateAction`, `useState`: Hooks and types from React used for state management.
  - `regUser`: Function imported from the application-specific API file to handle user registration.
  - `useRouter`: Hook from Next.js used for accessing the router object.
  - `useDispatch`: Hook from React Redux used for accessing the dispatch function.
  - `setToken`: Function imported from the Redux slice file to set the authentication token in the Redux store.

- **Props**:
  - `setIsOpen`: Function passed as a prop to control the state of the registration window.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `Register` function component initializes state variables `username`, `password`, `phoneNumber`, and `password2` using the `useState` hook.
  - It defines a function `handleFormSubmit` to handle form submission. It prevents the default form submission behavior, validates the input fields, and sends an API request to register the user.
  - Upon successful registration, it dispatches an action to store the authentication token in the Redux store and redirects the user to the home page.
  - The JSX returned by the component represents the registration form:
    - It contains input fields for the username, phone number, password, and confirm password, styled using Tailwind CSS classes.
    - The submit button triggers the `handleFormSubmit` function when clicked.
    - The "Sign in" link allows users to switch to the login form by calling the `setIsOpen` function passed as a prop.

## Conclusion

The `Register` component provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their registration details and sign up for a new account. It utilizes React hooks for state management and Next.js router for navigation. By encapsulating the registration logic within a reusable component, this promotes code reusability and maintainability, enhancing the overall user experience of the application.
