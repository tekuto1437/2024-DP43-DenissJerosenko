# Wishlist Component Explanation

The `Wishlist` component is responsible for rendering the user's wishlist. It displays a list of products that the user has added to their wishlist. It also provides a link to navigate back to the home page.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports**:

  - `Link`: Component imported from Next.js for client-side navigation.
  - `useAppSelector`: Custom hook imported from the application-specific hooks file for accessing Redux store state.
  - `Product`: Type imported from the application-specific types file representing a product.
  - `WishListProduct`: Component imported from the application-specific components directory representing an individual product in the wishlist.

- **State**:

  - `products`: State variable obtained from Redux store state using the `useAppSelector` hook to access the list of products in the wishlist.

- **Functionality**:
  - The JSX returned by the component renders a container with flex layout (`flex`) to center-align its content.
  - Within the container, it renders a column (`flex-col`) with a link to the home page (`/`), the title "Wishlist," and the total number of items in the wishlist.
  - It then renders a grid layout (`grid-cols`) to display the wishlist products. For each product in the wishlist, it renders a `WishListProduct` component passing the product data as a prop.

## Conclusion

The `Wishlist` component plays a crucial role in the user interface of the application by providing users with a convenient way to view and manage their wishlist items. By leveraging client-side navigation and Redux state management, it ensures efficient rendering and navigation while displaying the wishlist products. Additionally, by organizing products in a grid layout, it offers users a visually appealing and user-friendly experience when browsing their wishlist.
