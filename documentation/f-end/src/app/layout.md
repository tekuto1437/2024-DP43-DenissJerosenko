# RootLayout Component Explanation

This component represents the root layout of the application. It defines the overall structure of the HTML document and includes global styles and common components such as the header and footer.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports**:

  - `ReactNode`: TypeScript type representing any valid React child node.
  - `Metadata`: Type imported from Next.js, representing metadata for the HTML document.
  - `Inter`: Font imported from Next.js for styling text elements.
  - `globals.css`: Global CSS styles imported from a CSS file.
  - `StoreProvider`: Component imported from `"./StoreProvider"`, providing the Redux store to the entire application.
  - `Footer`, `Header`: Components imported from `"./components/Footer"` and `"./components/Header"` respectively, representing the footer and header of the application.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `RootLayout` function component receives `children` as props, which represent the child components rendered inside the layout.
  - The `inter` variable is created to define the font used throughout the application. It specifies the Inter font with the Latin subset.
  - The `metadata` object defines metadata for the HTML document, including the title and description.
  - The function returns JSX representing the structure of the HTML document:
    - The `<html>` element specifies the document's language as English (`en`).
    - The `<body>` element includes the Inter font class name for styling text elements.
    - The `<StoreProvider>` component wraps the entire application, providing access to the Redux store.
    - The `<Header>` and `<Footer>` components are rendered to display the header and footer of the application respectively.
    - The `children` prop is rendered within a `<div>` element, allowing for dynamic content rendering.

## Conclusion

The `RootLayout` component serves as the foundation for the entire application layout. It defines the overall structure of the HTML document, includes global styles and fonts, and renders common components such as the header and footer. By encapsulating common layout elements and providing access to application-wide state, this component promotes code reusability and maintainability.
