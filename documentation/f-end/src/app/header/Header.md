- It is conditionally rendered based on the state of `showCart`.

Overall, the `Header` component provides a responsive navigation experience with dynamic rendering based on the application's state and screen size.

- Within the overlay, there is a slide-over panel containing the cart content.
- The panel includes the title "Shopping cart", a button to close the panel, a list of cart items, subtotal, and buttons for checkout and continuing shopping.
