# ProductPage Component Explanation

This component represents a page in the application for displaying details of a specific product. It fetches the product details from an API endpoint based on the provided `productId` parameter and renders the product information along with options to add the product to the cart or wishlist.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports**:
  - `useEffect`, `useState`: Hooks from React used for side effects and state management.
  - `Product`: Type imported from the application-specific types file representing a product.
  - `handleItem`, `addWish`: Functions imported from the application-specific slices files for handling cart and wishlist actions.
  - `useAppDispatch`: Custom hook imported from the application-specific hooks file for accessing the Redux dispatch function.

- **Props**:
  - `params.productId`: A string representing the unique identifier of the product passed as a parameter to the component.

- **State**:
  - `item`: State variable to store the details of the fetched product.
  - `defaultSize`: State variable to store the default selected size of the product.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `ProductPage` function component fetches the details of the product with the specified `productId` from an API endpoint using the `useEffect` hook when the component mounts.
  - Upon receiving the data, it updates the `item` state variable with the fetched product details and sets the default size based on the available sizes of the product.
  - The JSX returned by the component renders the product details including its image, name, description, price, availability, and size options.
  - It provides buttons to add the product to the cart or wishlist. Clicking on these buttons dispatches the corresponding actions using the `useAppDispatch` hook.
  - Users can select a size from the available options, and the selected size is highlighted.

## Conclusion

The `ProductPage` component serves as a crucial part of the application's user interface, allowing users to view detailed information about a specific product and take actions such as adding it to the cart or wishlist. By leveraging React hooks for data fetching and state management, it ensures efficient loading and rendering of product details. Additionally, by integrating with Redux for managing application state and dispatching actions, it enables seamless interaction with other parts of the application.
