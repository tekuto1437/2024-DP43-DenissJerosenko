# ProductsPage Component Explanation

The `ProductsPage` component is responsible for displaying a list of products grouped by categories. It fetches the products list from an API endpoint and organizes them by category. For each category, it renders a section with the category name and a grid layout displaying the products belonging to that category.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports**:

  - `useEffect`, `useState`: Hooks from React used for side effects and state management.
  - `Category`, `Product`: Types imported from the application-specific types file representing categories and products.
  - `getProductsList`: Function imported from the application-specific API file for fetching the list of products.
  - `ProductItem`: Component imported from the application-specific components directory representing an individual product item.

- **State**:

  - `productsList`: State variable to store the list of categories and their respective products.

- **Functionality**:
  - The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the products list from the API endpoint when the component mounts. Upon receiving the data, it updates the `productsList` state variable with the fetched data.
  - The JSX returned by the component iterates over each category in the `productsList` state and renders a section for each category.
  - Within each category section, it renders the category name and a grid layout (`grid-cols`) for displaying the products. For each product in the category, it renders a `ProductItem` component passing the product data as a prop.
  - The `ProductItem` component is responsible for rendering the details of an individual product.

## Conclusion

The `ProductsPage` component serves as a key part of the application's user interface for showcasing a list of products grouped by categories. By leveraging React hooks for data fetching and state management, it ensures efficient loading and rendering of product data. Additionally, by organizing products by category and utilizing a grid layout for display, it provides users with a visually appealing and organized browsing experience.
